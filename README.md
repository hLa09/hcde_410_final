# HCDE_410_final

This is a Final Project Preliminary Proposal for the course HCDE 410, in Human Center Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle.

Within this A4 assignment is my proposal topic on what I will like to discuss about for the final project.
I would like to look into the crime rate in the City of Tacoma. Tacoma is a city that I lived in when I am not attending school. When I think back to the place I will be visiting, it interesting to explore what occuring in the area.
I am acknowledge that looking into such information can lead to bias, though I will keep an open-minded as a researcher to looking into the data of crime and type of crime occur in the area of Tacoma. For this assignment I am interesting in the information on the type of crimes often occur, and the area most occur in. It would be cool if I get to know about how often the type of crime are occuring, and whether is there hate bias with the crime involved.

Though there will be section that I will be writting about my plan A5, and the A7 section is my final report:

In this project I will walk you through the process of analyzing the crime occuring in the City of Tacoma. The main focus of this project is to understand what type of crime is most common? In which neighborhood has the most crime? Other than that if time permit, I will like to look at what day of the week occur more crime activity? This project is motivate by the interest in learning about the incident occur in the City of Tacoma, and the goal is to using dataset we found to form an understanding of the data information based on the research questions. We will be using dataset from Tacoma Open Data, especially the Crime Data, and the Hate Bias datasets to help me answers the research questions that raises.

Within the final report I will be analyzing data based on the following research questions:

- What is the common crime occur in the City of Tacoma since 2021 - 2023?
- In which neighborhood or part of Tacoma has the most crime activity from 2021 - 2023?
- If possible, is there a hate bias crime in Tacoma?
- If possible, what day of the week seem to have most crime activity in Tacoma?

DATA SOURCE AND LICENSES: The data we're using are from Tacoma Open Data, this develop and maintain from the City of Tacoma. This dataset does have a license through MIT license, an open source initiative approved license.

The following datasets are what I have found and will be take deeper look:

- DISPATCH DATA: https://data.cityoftacoma.org/datasets/f376e2e05a64471dafa41e73a1b8280b_0/explore
- OTHER POTENTIAL DATA: HATE BIAS: https://data.cityoftacoma.org/datasets/d8c537f2afc745acaf53dc7c46cfc6d2_0/explore
